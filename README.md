## Implemented Algorithms
- Normal Minimax
- Normal Minimax with Transposition Table optimization (Dynamic Programming)
- Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning
- Q Learning using the Q-table approach

## Features
- [x] 3 Different Levels For each Algorithm
- [ ] Showing pop-up window with progress bar while Q-Learning agent is getting trained
